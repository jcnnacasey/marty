        <p>now, this is not exactly a "simple" 
        invention. however, it is something 
        that i feel like needs to be invented.
        why should someone with bad eyesight 
        have to pay for new glasses every time
        their prescription changes? they 
        shouldn't, right? well, it is time for
        someone to invent glasses that have 
        lenses that automatically adjust to
        each invidiual person's eyesight or
        prescription. therefore, you would 
        only everneed one pair, but this 
        <em>one</em> pair would adjust to outside
        conditions and the workings of your 
        own eye to work best for <em>you.</em></p>
